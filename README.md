# JAVA
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[17] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.# what is java?
java is a simple langauage

High-level-language ---> assembly language ---> machin language<0,1> ---> HardWare


# list of the java
1) serverSide --> JAVA Standard/Enterprise Edition.(JAVA SE,EE)
2) java Android.
3) Electronic devices --> java Micro Edition.
4) java Card

# JDK
java Develop ket ==> that allow us to compile the java code.
jvm is on it.
## JVM Architecture
JVM(Java Virtual Machine) runs Java applications as a run-time engine. JVM is the one that calls the main method present in a Java code. JVM is a part of JRE(Java Runtime Environment).

Java applications are called WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere). This means a programmer can develop Java code on one system and expect it to run on any other Java-enabled system without any adjustment. This is all possible because of JVM.

When we compile a .java file, .class files(contains byte-code) with the same class names present in .java file are generated by the Java compiler. This .class file goes into various steps when we run it. These steps together describe the whole JVM. 
all code jave run by this.

1) jvm --> os --> hardware
2) java.code.java ---> JAVAC(java compiler) ---> Byte Code (.class) (interpreted)---> JAVM(machineCode)

* c++ run on os directly
* c# run on .net

## JRE
a part bit onJDK that just run JAVA compile

# Bytecode
![alt text](./bytecode.png)
Bytecode is computer object code that an interpreter converts into binary machine code so it can be read by a computer's hardware processor. The interpreter is typically implemented as a virtual machine (VM) that translates the bytecode for the target platform. The machine code consists of a set of instructions that the processor understands.
c++ =< system program  low-level programming.>=> code ---> Compile
java =software development or web-based application development==>
code --> JAVAC<javaCompiler> --> ByteCode<.class> JVM<classLoader,ByteCodeVerifier,JITCompiler> --> native Machine Code<001101>

bit --> byte --> character --> word
# mean
1) platform Independence --> write a programmer that run in all envirement.
2) cross-platform 
3) portable --> transform a programing and run to a lot os.
4) Architecture Neutral
5) Write Once Run Anywhere

# Code
## First
```
    public class <nameFile>{
         public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("salam!!!");
    }
    }
    ### 1) Compile it with javac ==> java.class
    ### 2) Run java with java


    java ---> .class ---> .class Run on JVM
```

# type
## PRIMITIVE TYPES
1) char
2) boolean

### NUMBER
1) byte
2) short
3) int 
4) long
#### Floating-Point Types
1) float
2) double
%.1f ==> just show 3.1415 ==> 3.1
### chnage Type
![alt text](./change_types.png)
1) byte can be change to short,int,long.float,double.
2) short ==> int,long,float,double.

### type casting
int intVal  == longval ==> error
lonval == intval ==> OK
int intVal == (int) longVal ==> OK (type casting)

### STRING
save a collection of char.
```
 String st = "Ahay Salam Ahay Salma!!!";
 charAt(0)==> A; 
 indexOf("Salam") ==> 5;
 lastIndexOf("Salam") ==> 16
 replace ==> "salam","chishod"
 substring ==> 1,3
 length
 equals
 equalsIgnoewCase
 concat ==> a + b ==> ab;
 contains ==> "salam" true

 \n ==> next line
 \t ==> tab

```
### ARRAY
``` 
    char[] array = {'a','s','t'};
    int[] array = new int[4];
    int array[] = new int[25];
    int [][] matrix = new int[3][4]
    matrix[2][3] = 2;
    for(int n: array){}
```
